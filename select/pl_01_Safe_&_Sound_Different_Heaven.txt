Fill me up
With your smile
Like the sunshine brings the
light
Fill me up
With a flame
I will let you win this game
Take me up when I'm down
Cause with you I'm safe and
sound
I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
Bring, bring, bring that beat
back!
Ooh yes!
Fill me up
With your smile
Like the sunshine brings the
light
Fill me up
With a flame
I will let you win this game
Take me up when I'm down
Cause with you I'm safe and
sound
I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
Bring, bring, bring, bring that
beat!
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
(I'm safe and sound)
