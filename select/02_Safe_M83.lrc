[00:44.37] Atomic roads, nuclear sunrise
[00:59.35] They left me all alone
[01:13.44] Falling stars exploding on the sea
[01:28.51] God it's beautiful
[01:37.51] 
[01:42.65] The land and the roses slowly disappeared
[01:58.70] Why am I so alone?
[02:12.88] A wounded angel is smiling at me
[02:22.86] God it's so beautiful
