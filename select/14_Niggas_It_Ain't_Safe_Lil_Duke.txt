Niggas ain't safe
I put that nut on your bae
I just been low, tryna stay out the way
Get to the bag, gotta know how to play
I'm tryna stay focused and fill up the safe
Can't go big on big
Hit a lil' nigga with a big old Fin
Oh, you not not on my kin
I'm poppin' that shit and I'm settin' the trend
Watch cost a brick and a split
You kicking that bitch and she sucking my dick
Five bands spent on a 'fit
We just been chillin', a whole lot of vibes at the Ritz
We just be stacking this paper and we
Stay together, I'm pulling my mans up
I got the strap in my hand, I'm firing,
I'm busting, ain't puttin' my hands up

We used to wake up and terrorize the block
How can we fall when we still at the top?
Whole lot of hoes and they come by the flock
Called 'em, I just caught a drop from a thot
Sellin' out shows and we bringin' 'em out
Few niggas lost they whole life for some clout
I used to get 'em in, get 'em right out
I'm a young mogul and they know my name in the South
I just be doing my bars, I'm switching the cars, I'm doing it large
Knew I would make it, I knew from the start
I was a star with a whole lot of heart
Sixth grade, got caught with some cash
I was moving it fast
All that hating on the sucker nigga shit
Bro, you won't last
I got a few snakes in the grass
Lot of bad bitches, they bad
They quick to wipe your lil' nose (Slatt)
Niggas be going out sad
Preach how you broke and you petty
Walk in the club, throw them racks like confetti
Runnin' through 36 hoes like I'm Bettis
You talkin' 'bout money, let's get it
'Cause I got a bad money fetish

Niggas ain't safe
I put that nut on your bae
I just been low, tryna stay out the way
Get to the bag, gotta know how to play
I'm tryna stay focused and fill up the safe
Can't go big on big
Hit a lil' nigga with a big old Fin
Oh, you not not on my kin
I'm poppin' that shit and I'm settin' the trend
Watch cost a brick and a split
You kicking that bitch and she sucking my dick
Five bands spent on a 'fit
We just been chillin', a whole lot of vibes at the Ritz
We just be stacking this paper and we
Stay together, I'm pulling my mans up
I got the strap in my hand, I'm firing,
I'm busting, ain't puttin' my hands up

I'm smoking on Gushers, think I was born with the hustle
Niggas play tough and they actin' all crazy, shit, I know I'ma bust
My niggas gon' go off the muscle
Burn niggas up like he Usher
Ho, ain't no way I can trust you
I'd rather get it myself
You can hear the pain in my voice
I been sippin' all this syrup, got me hoarse
Leave these bitches with the quickness, no remorse
I'm 'bout to go to the dealership and get that Porsche
Now they gotta pay me for my voice
I had to rap 'cause this shit was a choice
Speaking with volume and I got a voice
Pull up, hop out the back of the Rolls Royce
Bitches, they say that I'm bad to the bone
Creed and Biscotti, yeah, that's my cologne
No, we not sparing shit, don't call my phone
Catch him down bad, we gon' send his ass home

Niggas ain't safe
I put that nut on your bae
I just been low, tryna stay out the way
Get to the bag, gotta know how to play
I'm tryna stay focused and fill up the safe
